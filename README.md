# dipsi
This program named dipsi suppose to be python module, which process full-disc images of photosphere and chromosphere. Its goal is to develope probability classification of solar features: sunspots, filaments, plages and flares. Curently it's under development, but it can be used for some minor tasks as limb darkening removal, non-radial variations removal via Zharkova algorithm, dark and bright solar features detection with table of properties for each feature as an output. The final and desired output suppose to use that table for probability classification and last function will add a column or columns with feature's type and probability of the right assignment.
